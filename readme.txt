all entered text gets stored into the history except when '$' character is at the beggining of the string or "q\n" which ends the program

$ command has multiple variations
  1) $_ deletes the history and frees the memory
  2) $#<n> retrieves the nth element of the history, tokenizes it, prints the tokens, and finally frees the tokens
  3) $ followed by anything other than 1) and 2) prints the history with id
  
  
  make run - run the program
